Youâ€™ll test find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

== Overview

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

=== Syntax highlighting

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

[source,shell]
puts "Hello, World!"

[source,java]
----
private void print(String s) {
   System.out.println(s);
}
