                Earlier we introduced Intrusion Detection System using Elytron&#8217;s security events and discussed its architecture. In this blog we&#8217;ll discuss the implementation of Rule Engine &amp; Blacklist IP Dump. Rule Engine Rule Engine comprises of a set of pre-defined rules, which are used to score the event on a scale of...

                Intrusion Detection is the art of sensing when a system or network is being used inappropriately or without authorization. Without intrusion detection, an attacker can attempt attacks many times until an attack is finally successful. Intrusion detection allows for these attacks to be identified before a successful attack is likely...

            <description>
                Elytron subsystem configuration was enhanced to allow possibility to define a regex based security roles mapping mechanism. With this functionality it is possible to easily translate list of roles, eg. app-admin, abc-user, to simpler roles , eg. admin, user. Add a regex role mapper You can add a regex-role-mapper to...

                The Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol became an IETF standard a little over a year ago. This protocol makes it possible to automate the process of obtaining signed certificates from a certificate authority without the need for human intervention. The WildFly Elytron project provides a Java ACME client SPI...

                For quite some time now, WildFly has provided support for server side Server Name Indication (SNI) matching. This allows a WildFly instance with multiple virtual hosts that share a single IP address to present the correct certificate depending on the server name specified by the client via the SNI extension....
